## Important Note About API Key
This project includes a Pexels API key in the client-side JavaScript code. I acknowledge that this is not a secure practice for production applications. However, for this academic project:

- The API key is from Pexels' free tier, which is intended for public use and learning
- As a student project focused on demonstrating API integration skills, I made the decision to include it directly

## Features
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Interactive navigation with smooth animations
- Project filtering system by categories
- Expandable project cards with transition effects
- Detailed project popups with image galleries
- Custom cursor design
- Dynamic content loading from Pexels API
